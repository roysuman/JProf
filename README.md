#Intro
 The aim of this project is to build an opensource Java profiler using JVMTI interface. The outcome of the profiler will be presented by a flame graphy.

#Thanks-giving:

Thank you [JEREMY MANSON][1], his blog and source code helped a lot to understand this concept, after reading his blog I got the idea of developing an opensource profiler. Though I have started developing this tool from scratch, but might find some code from Jermy's code base(specifically makefile).
